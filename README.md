# Innovation project for Electronic system design and innovation

This git is my part of our group project to use sensors with arduino IDE, send that data to a website.

I've been whole responsible to design a breakout board suitable to the ESP32 mikrokontroller.
The circuit board have been made with NTNUs manufacturing capabilities in mind, 
and have therefore all connection at the bottom of the board.

I've also combines all the individual codes and made them work together.
